            "Music studio assistant Yahaya Sharif-Aminu was sentenced to death by hanging on August 10 after being convicted of blasphemy by an Islamic court in northern Nigeria. ",
            "The judgment document states that Sharif-Aminu, 22, was convicted for making \"a blasphemous statement against Prophet Mohammed in a WhatsApp Group,\" which is contrary to the Kano State Sharia Penal Code and is an offence which carries the death sentence. ",
            "The recording was shared widely, causing mass outrage in the highly conservative, majority Muslim, state, according to various reports. ",
            "\"Whoever insults, defames or utters words or acts which are capable of bringing into disrespect ... such a person has committed a serious crime which is punishable by death,\" according to a translation of court documents provided to CNN by his lawyers. ",

            "Sharif-Aminu, described by his friend Kabiru Ibrahim, as \"kind, religious and dutiful,\" admitted charges of blasphemy during his trial, but said he had made a mistake. ",
            "No legal representation",
            "Under Sharia law, a voluntary confession is binding, according to court papers. ",
            "Sharif-Aminu's lawyers, who became involved in the case only after his conviction, say he was not allowed legal representation before or during his trial -- in contravention of Nigerian citizens' constitutional right to legal representation. ",
            "Outrage as Nigeria sentences 13-year-old boy to 10 years in prison for blasphemy",
            "According to the lawyers, the Sharia court adjourned his case four times because no lawyer came forth from the Legal Aid Council to represent him, likely because of the sensitivity of the case. The Sharia court is, however, statute-bound to provide legal representation.",

            "The FRF says it has lodged an appeal on his behalf in Kano's high court, a common-law court with constitutional powers. ",
            "\"The state laws he is accused of breaking are in gross conflict with the Nigerian constitution,\" said his counsel, Kola Alapinni. ",

People hold Prophet Mohammed higher than their parents, and when things like this happen, it will lead to a breakdown of peace because of mob action and attacks against the accused.\" ",
            "When news of Sharif-Aminu's alleged crime broke earlier this year, protesters marched to his family home and destroyed it, prompting his father to flee to a neighboring town, his lawyers told CNN. Sharif-Aminu went into hiding, according to Amnesty and his lawyers, but in March he was arrested by the Hisbah Corps, the religious police force that enforces Sharia law in Kano state. ",
            "'A travesty of justice'",
            "Human rights organization Amnesty International has described Sharif-Aminu's trial as a \"travesty of justice,\" and called on Kano state authorities to quash his conviction and death sentence. ",
            "\"There are serious concerns about the fairness of his trial and the framing of the charges against him based on his Whatsapp messages,\" said Amnesty's Nigeria director Osai Ojigho. \"Furthermore, the imposition of the death penalty following an unfair trial violates the right to life,\" she added. ",
            "The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has also condemned Sharif-Aminu's death sentence. It said Nigeria's blasphemy laws were inconsistent with universal human rights standards. ",
            "\"It is unconscionable that Sharif-Aminu is facing a death sentence merely for expressing his beliefs artistically through music,\" said the organization's commissioner, Frederick A. Davie, in a statement. ",

            "Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and religion permeates every facet of life here, with prayers routinely said in schools and public offices. In addition to blasphemy, atheism is frowned upon by many in the majority Muslim north as well as in parts of the mostly Christian south. ",
